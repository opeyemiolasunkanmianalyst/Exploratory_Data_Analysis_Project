### Background
Having analysed the dataset using python programming language, the following information was discovered.

### Key Insights
- The average sales is 3553 dollars while the mimimum and maximum are 482 and 14082 dollars respectively.
- The sales was increasing from 2003 to 2004 but it drastically went down in 2005. The quarterly review shows that the last quarters of the first two years had the higest sales for each year before the crash of the following year.
- More than 95% of the orders were shipped in the first two years but reduced to less than 75% in the following year
- Out of the 19 countries, customers from USA alone makes up 36% of the total sales and the top 5 countries combined [USA(36.13%), Spain(12.12%), France(11.0%), Australia(6.29%) and -UK(4.77%)] makes up 70% of the total sales 
- Out of 73 cities, Madrid has the higest sales of 10% and five of the top 10 cities are from USA.
- The top 20 products out of 109 account for about 30% of total sales.
- Diego Freyre(9.1%) and Valarie Nelson(6.1%) are the top two customers. Out of 92 customers, they are responsible for 
15% of total sales
- Medium size deals account for 60% of all sales

### Recommendations
- There was a need to investigate why there was a drastic drop in sales in 2005.

- The company should find a way to improve sales in other 14 countries apart from the top 5

- The company should also brainstorm on a market strategy that will improve the sales of products outside the top 20.

- The marketers should also investigate why Diego Freyre and Valarie Nelson has invested so much in the company's products. This might help in attracting and improving the interest of other customers
